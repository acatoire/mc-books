Anteaters are native to Central and South America. They have no teeth, but they utilize their long tongue (longer than any other mammal) to eat. Their sense of smell is 40 times greater than humans, which helps them identify food sources.

### 🧠 Behavior

Anteaters are neutral mobs that spawn near ant hills. They wander around aimlessly while sniffing the ground or the air. When they get hungry, they will dig into ant hills to draw out a crunchy snack.

Anteaters, when tamed, will occasionally dig in the ground for random items and can pop up items such as beetles, ants, golden nuggets, hanging roots, bones, or even live moles!

### ❤️ Taming, Healing, & Feeding

An anteater can be tamed with termites and ants. There is a 75% chance of successful taming. Once they are tamed, you will see hearts appear, and a shirt will appear on their body, signifying you have tamed the anteater. You can dye the shirt to your color of choice or use shears to cut off the shirt. If you shear off the shirt, it can be reapplied by using a dye color of your choice.

Tamed anteaters cannot be commanded, nor will they follow a player at any time. To keep your anteaters within a certain area, you can put a lead on them and tie them to a fence or build a corral around them.

### 🥚Breeding

Adult anteaters with full health can be [bred](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Breeding) with [honeycomb](/minecraft.wiki/w/Honeycomb). There is a 5-minute cooldown for breeding, during which the anteaters do not accept honeycomb for breeding.

Baby anteaters will ride on their parents until they grow up, upon which they will immediately dismount. The growth of pups can be slowly accelerated by using ants and queen ants.
