Bass are passive aquatic fish that swim in groups in swampy biomes and rivers. These bass are prey of players and animals alike as they are a great source of food. If you grow your food, make sure to catch this passive fish in a bucket and give it a new home!

### 🌎 Spawning

Bass spawns in groups of 1-4 underwater in [swampland](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Swamp), [rivers](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/River), & variants of each biome as long as it’s not frozen. Various animals commonly hunt these fish, so you may discover remnants of these fish floating upon the water. If you want to catch one of these fish in a bucket, check your surroundings to ensure you don’t become the prey!

### 🧠 Behavior

Bass are passive aquatic creatures that tend to swim in schools with a maximum of four per school.

The player may collect bass by using a [water bucket](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Water_bucket) on it, which gives the player a bucket of bass. Bass placed with buckets do not despawn naturally. When that fish bucket is used against a block, it empties the bucket, placing water with the bass swimming in it.

**Weakness:**

Bass are unable to survive out of water. Outside of water, they flop around for a while until, eventually, they start to suffocate and die. Bass cannot be put in a [cauldron](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Cauldron).

Bass are vulnerable to weapons that have the [Impaling](Bass%201dd816019a9f81379eecf7c25ed7e23f.md) enchantment.
