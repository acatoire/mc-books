Capybaras are the world‚Äôs largest rodents. They are semi-aquatic creatures that are excellent swimmers. Capybaras are relaxed creatures around other species, so you may find a Capybara riding on an alligator!

### üåé Spawning

Capybaras spawn in a herd of 2-4 in the [jungle](/minecraft.wiki/w/Jungle), [jungle edge](/minecraft.wiki/w/Sparse_Jungle), and [swamps](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Swamp). These climates are typically warm, so you won‚Äôt find capybara anywhere near frozen variants of those biomes!

### üß† Behavior

Capybaras are entirely passive animals. They aimlessly wander around, but you can sometimes find them riding an alligator! Occasionally, small animals will ride on a capybara, such as birds, squirrels, and other small animals. If a player hits them, they will panic and lose their rider in the process.

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Taming, Healing, & Feeding

Capybaras can be tamed with [melon slices](/minecraft.wiki/w/Melon_Slice). There is a 33% chance of successful taming. Once they are tamed, you will see hearts appear and a collar with a gold medallion hanging around their neck signifying you have tamed the capybara. You can [dye](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Dye) the collar to your color of choice or use [shears](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Shears) to cut off the collar. If you shear off the collar, it can be reapplied by using a dye color of your choice.

Tamed capybaras can be commanded to sit or roam.

- Capybaras will not teleport to the player if the capybara is in roam mode and the player is far away.
- Capybaras will not teleport to the player if they are commanded to sit.

If a capybara you have tamed gets injured, you can feed the capybara melon slices to increase its [health](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Health) until it is maxed. 1 melon slice increases the bird‚Äôs health points by 2. An injured capybara will be unable to breed until it is healed. 

---

### ü•öBreeding

Adult Capybaras with full health can be [bred](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Breeding) with melon slices. There is a 5-minute cooldown for breeding, during which the capybara will not accept melon slices but will if they get injured and need to heal.

Upon successful breeding, a pup will be born. The growth of pups can be slowly accelerated by using melon slices.
