Clams are aquatic creatures with hard shells that are difficult to break open. The shells range from white to brown coloration, and these shells can regenerate if damaged. Clam meat is an excellent food source if a player can spot these creatures, and occasionally, you may find a treasure!

### üåé Spawning

Clams will spawn by themselves within the ocean. If you find yourself in a frozen ocean, you won‚Äôt find any clams, as they prefer warmer water! You will find clams between Y 64 and Y -20.

### üß† Behavior

Clams are passive aquatic creatures that are completely invulnerable to all damage when they are closed. A player can damage a clam when they are open. There is a 20% chance of a clam having an item inside its mouth, which the player can collect upon death. Their mouths will open and close at random intervals, so you must be patient if you want to collect some clam meat!
