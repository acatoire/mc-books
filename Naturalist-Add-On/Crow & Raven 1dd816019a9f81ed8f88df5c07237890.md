Crows and ravens are remarkable creatures that are intelligent. They are observant birds that use clever tactics to obtain food and face challenges in their environment. These birds often live in groups, which promotes their survival rate as they separate into hunting and protecting their homes. These animals have incredible memory, they can remember human faces and house that information for years, so be sure to stay on the friendly side with these unique creatures.

### üß† Behavior

Crows and Ravens are passive birds that tend to avoid other mobs and players. You can get their attention with their favorite foods to tempt them. They will fly around idly and land frequently to rest. They will flap their wings to swim and to mitigate fall damage.

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Taming, Healing, & Feeding

Crows and ravens can be tamed with [wheat seeds](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Wheat_Seeds), [pumpkin seeds](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pumpkin_Seeds), [melon seeds](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Melon_Seeds), and [beetroot seeds](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Beetroot_Seeds).  There is a 33% chance of successful taming. Once they are tamed, you will see hearts appear and a ribbon on their left leg signifying you have tamed the bird. You can [dye](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Dye) the ribbon to your color of choice or use [shears](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Shears) to cut off the ribbon. If you shear off the ribbon, it can be reapplied by using a dye color of your choice.

Tamed crows and ravens can be commanded to sit or to follow.

- They will teleport to the player if the player is further than 5 blocks away.
- They will not teleport to the player if they are commanded to sit.

If a crow or raven you have tamed gets injured, you can feed them wheat seeds, pumpkin seeds, melon seeds, or beetroot seeds to increase its [health](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Health) until it is maxed. 1 seed increases the bird‚Äôs health points by 2. An injured bird will be unable to breed until it is healed. 

Feeding a crow or raven a [cookie](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Cookie) will cause [Fatal Poison](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Fatal_Poison) particles to be emitted, and they will lose health points. Chocolate is toxic to birds.

**Note:** *Unlike [Parrots](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Parrot), these birds do not dance to a jukebox when it is playing music.*

### ü•öBreeding

Crows and Ravens with full health can be [bred](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Breeding) with beetroot seeds, melon seeds, pumpkin seeds, torchflower seeds, and wheat seeds. There is a 5-minute cooldown for breeding, during which the birds do not accept any seeds for breeding but will if they get injured and need to heal. Birds require the following [leaves](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Leaves) to be within a 5-block radius for breeding to initiate: Acacia leaves, azalea leaves, flowering azalea leaves, birch leaves, cherry leaves, dark oak leaves, jungle leaves, mangrove leaves, oak leaves, and spruce leaves.

The two birds will create a bird nest containing an egg after successful breeding. If in survival mode, the nest & egg can be broken with 1 hit, and it will drop as an item. Once the egg is placed in the world, the egg hatch timer will restart. There are no visuals for the egg hatching, however, a cracking sound will emit when the egg hatches and a bird appears.

*Note: When breeding, crows breed with crows, and ravens breed with ravens. These birds cannot be crossbred.*
