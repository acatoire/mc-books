Desert scorpions are the largest scorpions in North America. They are equipped with powerful pincers, and they contain venom that has been evolved to be effective against creatures and humans alike. They are incredibly resilient to the harsh heat the desert provides and have slow metabolisms to conserve their resources.

### üåé Spawning

A bed of 1-4 desert scorpions will spawn in the [desert](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Desert) and [mesa plateau stone](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Wooded_Badlands) biomes. They will spawn during the daytime with [light levels](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Light) between 7-15.

### ‚öîÔ∏è Drops

Desert Scorpion [drops](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Drops) upon death:

- 1 Scorpion Poison Gland
    - ‚öîÔ∏è The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of [Looting](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Looting), for a maximum of 1-3 with Looting III
- üü¢ 3 [Experience](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Experience) Orbs if killed by Player

### üß† Behavior

Scorpions are passive arthropods that roam the desert biomes. They will hunt lizards, beetles, and termites.

If the player attacks a desert scorpion, they will chase the player at high speeds to attack back. If their attack is successful, the player will be dealt poison damage. The only way to negate the poison is to have an antivenom potion readily available.

Antivenom potions can be crafted with the poison gland that a scorpion drops upon death.

**Capture Net:**

Desert scorpions can be caught in capture nets. If a desert scorpion is caught, it will enter a player‚Äôs inventory as an item. If the inventory is full, the desert scorpion will drop to the ground in front of the player.

- A desert scorpion is used by pressing¬†‚Äùuse‚Äù¬†on any surface (top, bottom, or side) of a block. When used on a top surface, the desert scorpion¬†appears with its feet immediately adjacent to the surface. This interaction is much like a [spawn egg](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Spawn_Egg). The surfaces of blocks are prioritized for spawning; if none are within reach, mobs can also be spawned in¬†[water](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Water).
