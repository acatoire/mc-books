Fennec foxes are dominant in the deserts of North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. They are identifiable by their large batlike ears and their pale colors, which make them distinct from other foxes. They live in underground dens with multiple exits for safety, but they also lounge during the day to come out at twilight to forage.

### üß† Behavior

Fennec foxes are neutral animals that primarily hunt other animals and roam nearby villages. 

Fennec foxes hunt chicken, rabbits, and baby turtles when they are on land. They can be spotted sneaking stealthily before pouncing on their next meal. Along with hunting for fresh meat, they will attack sweet berry bushes and cave fines for berries to eat. They will not be damaged by sweet berry bushes when they rub up against them.

Fennec foxes attack either by running against or pouncing. Like rabbits and foxes, they can jump more than one block high without status effects or player input. They prepare to jump by tilting and lowering their head and body before jumping/pouncing at least two blocks in the air.  It can jump over fences and walls if needed. If fennec foxes are attached to a lead, they will attempt to run towards their prey but be unable to break the lead.

Fennec foxes will avoid wolves, polar bears, and players unless the player approaches them by sneaking or if they are tamed.

Wild fennec foxes will sit down during the day if they are unable to find a shaded area to nap in. They will not sleep during thunderstorms, and they will find cover if it is thunderstorming.

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Taming, Healing, & Feeding

Fennec foxes can be tamed with [sweet berries](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Sweet_Berries) and [glow berries](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Glow_Berries). There is a 50% chance of successful taming. Once they are tamed, you will see hearts appear and a collar around their neck signifying you have tamed the fennec fox. You can [dye](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Dye) the collar to your color of choice or use shears to cut off the collar. If you [shear](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Shears) off the collar, it can be reapplied by using a dye color of your choice. 

Tamed fennec foxes can be commanded to sit or follow.

- Fennec foxes will teleport to the player if the player is further than 10 blocks away.
- Fennec foxes will not teleport to the player if they are commanded to sit.

If a fennec fox you have tamed gets injured, you can feed it sweet berries and glow berries to increase its [health](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Health) until it is maxed. 1 sweet berry increases the fennec fox‚Äôs health points by 2 and glow berries increase the health points by 3. An injured fennec fox will be unable to breed until it is healed.

### ü•öBreeding

Fennec foxes with full health can be [bred](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Breeding) with [sweet berries](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Sweet_Berries) and [glow berries](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Glow_Berries). There is a 5-minute cooldown for breeding, during which the fennec foxes will not accept any berries but will if they get injured and need to heal.

Upon successful breeding, a kit will be born. The growth of kits can be slowly accelerated by using berries.
