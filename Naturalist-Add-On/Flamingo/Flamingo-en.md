Flamingos are famous for their bright pink feathers, long legs, and their S-shaped necks. These birds are typically found in Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Europe. They typically stand on one leg to conserve heat, with their darker feathers absorbing heat and their lighter feathers reflecting sunlight. Their diets consist of bugs, seeds, and some meat. Be sure to carry around some leftovers to tempt these birds into coming home with you!
