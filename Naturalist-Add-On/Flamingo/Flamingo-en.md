Flamingos are famous for their bright pink feathers, long legs, and their S-shaped necks. These birds are typically found in Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Europe. They typically stand on one leg to conserve heat, with their darker feathers absorbing heat and their lighter feathers reflecting sunlight. Their diets consist of bugs, seeds, and some meat. Be sure to carry around some leftovers to tempt these birds into coming home with you!

### üåé Spawning

Flamingos will spawn in a flock of 3-6 during the daytime with [light levels](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Light) between 7-15. They will hang out on the [beach](/minecraft.wiki/w/Beach) or in a [swamp](/minecraft.wiki/w/Swamp) biome. Flamingos migrate towards warmer weather towards the wintertime, so you will not find them anywhere frozen or even on a cold beach. They will spawn on [sand](/minecraft.wiki/w/Sand), [grass](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Grass_Block), [mud](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Mud), [mangrove roots](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Mangrove_Roots), and [muddy mangrove roots](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Muddy_Mangrove_Roots).
