Giraffes reside in the sub-Saharan African savannas and are the tallest mammals on the planet, with their necks up to 7.9 feet long! With necks this long, they cannot bend their necks to drink water, instead, they splay their front legs to get closer to the ground so they can drink water. Giraffes have unique spots, all displayed in different patterns, which makes each animal identifiable in their own way, as no two sets of spots are the same!

### üß† Behavior

Giraffes are passive animals that galivant across the savanna.  They can be easily spotted with their long legs and even longer necks, reaching the size of acacia trees! If you‚Äôre lucky, you‚Äôll spot a calf following its parent to stay protected from other wild animals.

They will aimlessly wander unless attacked by a player, then they will panic for a short time. 

Giraffes, once tamed, will allow you to place a [saddle](/minecraft.wiki/w/Saddle) on its back. The saddle can be removed by riding the moose and opening their inventory.

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Taming, Healing, & Feeding

Giraffes can be tamed with [apples](/minecraft.wiki/w/Apple) and [golden apples](/minecraft.wiki/w/Golden_Apple) or by riding them. There is a 100% chance of successful taming unless you are exclusively attempting to ride it. Once they are tamed, you will see hearts appear. There is no visual indication that they are tamed other than the hearts, however, the giraffe will let you ride it once it is tamed without throwing you off.

Tamed giraffes cannot be commanded, nor will they follow a player at any time. To keep your giraffe within a certain area, you can put a [lead](/minecraft.wiki/w/Lead) on them and tie them to a [fence](/minecraft.wiki/w/Wooden_Fence) or build a corral around them. 

If a giraffe you have tamed gets injured, you can feed the giraffe apples, golden apples, and hay blocks to increase its [health](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Health) until it is maxed. 1 apple or golden apple increases the giraffe‚Äôs health points by 2 and a hay block increases its health points by 20. An injured giraffe will be unable to breed until it is healed.

### ü•öBreeding

Adult giraffes with full health can be [bred](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Breeding) with [hay blocks](/minecraft.wiki/w/Hay_Bale). There is a 5-minute cooldown for breeding, during which the giraffe does not accept hay blocks for breeding but will if they get injured and need to heal.

Upon successful breeding, a calf will be born. The growth of calves can be slowly accelerated by using apples, golden apples, and hay blocks.
