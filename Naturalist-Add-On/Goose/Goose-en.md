Geese are social animals that are often seen in large groups known as flocks. They have a strong sense of community and rely on each other for protection and foraging. These birds migrate to warmer temperatures and fly in a V-shaped formation to conserve energy and communicate during flight. Geese are herbivorous and love to munch on seeds!

### üß† Behavior

Geese are passive birds that can be found in flocks of up to 5 birds. You can find them swimming in nearby waters or slapping their webbed feet on the ground. Geese love to swim; they will bring in their legs and float on water as they move about. They wander around aimlessly, but they will follow a player with seeds much like a chicken does!

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Taming, Healing, & Feeding

Geese can be tamed with [wheat seeds](/minecraft.wiki/w/Wheat_Seeds), [beetroot seeds](/minecraft.wiki/w/Beetroot_Seeds), [melon seeds](/minecraft.wiki/w/Melon_Seeds), [pumpkin seeds](/minecraft.wiki/w/Pumpkin_Seeds), [pitcher pods](/minecraft.wiki/w/Pitcher_Pod), and [torchflower seeds](/minecraft.wiki/w/Torchflower_Seeds). There is a 33% chance of successful taming. Once they are tamed, you will see hearts appear and a bow at the base of their neck signifying you have tamed the goose. You can [dye](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Dye) the bow to your color of choice or use [shears](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Shears) to cut off the bow. If you shear off the bow, it can be reapplied by using a dye color of your choice.

Tamed geese can be commanded to sit or to follow.

- Geese will teleport to the player if the player is further than 10 blocks away.
- Geese will not teleport to the player if they are commanded to sit.

If a goose you have tamed gets injured, you can feed it wheat seeds, beetroot seeds, melon seeds, pumpkin seeds, pitcher pods, and torchflower seeds to increase its [health](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Health) until it is maxed. 1 seed or pod increases the goose‚Äôs health points by 2. An injured goose will be unable to breed until it is healed.

### ü•öBreeding

Adult geese with full health can be [bred](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Breeding) with [wheat seeds](/minecraft.wiki/w/Wheat_Seeds), [beetroot seeds](/minecraft.wiki/w/Beetroot_Seeds), [melon seeds](/minecraft.wiki/w/Melon_Seeds), [pumpkin seeds](/minecraft.wiki/w/Pumpkin_Seeds), [pitcher pods](/minecraft.wiki/w/Pitcher_Pod), and [torchflower seeds](/minecraft.wiki/w/Torchflower_Seeds). There is a 5-minute cooldown for breeding, during which the goose does not accept seeds for breeding but will if they get injured and need to heal.

Upon successful breeding, a gosling will be born. The growth of goslings can be slowly accelerated by using seeds.
