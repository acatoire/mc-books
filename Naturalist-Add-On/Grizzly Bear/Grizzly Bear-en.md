Grizzly bears originally got their name based on the word ‚Äúgrisly‚Äù which means gruesome or scary. These bears are known as apex predators and will hunt large animals or fish when near rivers. They enjoy scrounging around for fresh berries and honeycomb with their long, straight claws. These bears are distinguished by a large hump in their back which is a large muscle which controls their forearms. These bears can run up to 30 mph, so be sure to keep your distance as they get angry when you are too close to their cubs!

### üß† Behavior

Grizzly bears can exist in a passive or hostile state. The cubs are passive; adults are hostile when provoked with cubs *(unless killed in one hit‚Äå)*. ‚Äî If a cub is attacked, unless killed in one hit‚Äå, all adults within the area become hostile toward the player or mob, regardless of [difficulty](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Difficulty). Players are not a grizzly bear‚Äôs only target, they will occasionally attack salmon, cod, bass, and deer.

They are animals that roam forests in search of food sources. You will spot them pulling berries off berry bushes and munching on honeycomb from nearby bee hives. When eating, they will sit down and chew on the food while it‚Äôs in their hand. Some items will give the bear special textures, like jelly on their paws while eating sweet berries or honey while eating honeycombs.

Bears sleep between the [ticks](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tick) of 6000-12000 and 18000-23000. While sleeping, they snore similar to [foxes](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Fox). If hit while sleeping, they will wake up in an aggressive state and will go back to sleep once they either kill their target or lose sight of them.

### ü•öBreeding

Adult grizzly bears with full health can be [bred](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Breeding) with [honeycomb](/minecraft.wiki/w/Honeycomb), [sweet berries](/minecraft.wiki/w/Sweet_Berries), [raw salmon](/minecraft.wiki/w/Raw_Salmon), [cooked salmon](/minecraft.wiki/w/Cooked_Salmon), and raw venison. There is a 5-minute cooldown for breeding, during which the grizzly bear will not accept any items for breeding.

Upon successful breeding, a cub will be born. The growth of cubs can be slowly accelerated by feeding them honeycomb, sweet berries, raw salmon, cooked salmon, and raw venison.
