Jellyfish are aquatic creatures but are not classified as fish. They are invertebrates that move gelatinously through the water. They come in many shapes and bright, vibrant colors. They utilize tentacles to catch their food along with their bodies that deliver stings to any creature that brushes against it.

### üß† Behavior

Jellyfish move in clusters across the ocean. Their bright colors make them easily identifiable, but they tend to blend in with coral reefs. 

Jellyfish are passive aquatic creatures; however, if a player brushes up against one, they will be stung. This damage mimics running into a cactus. 

The player may collect jellyfish and small jellyfish by¬†using¬†a¬†[water bucket](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Water_bucket)¬†on it, which gives the player a¬†bucket of jellyfish/bucket of small jellyfish (with their variant color). Jellyfish placed with buckets do not despawn naturally. When that bucket is¬†used¬†against a block, it empties the bucket, placing water with the jellyfish swimming in it.

**Weakness:**

Jellyfish are unable to survive out of water. Outside of water, they lay with tentacles splayed around them until, eventually, they start to suffocate and die. Jellyfish cannot be put in a [cauldron](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Cauldron).
