Kiwi birds are the smallest bird of flightless bird groups. They are half blind but have cat-like whiskers and short feathers to suit the ground lifestyle and to stay warm. Kiwis utilize their impeccable sense of smell to compensate for their vision to find seeds.

### üåé Spawning

Kiwis will spawn in a tribe of 1-3 birds in the jungle biome. These birds love to take long swims in the water, so if you can‚Äôt find them on land in the jungle, check a nearby river!

### üß† Behavior

Kiwis are passive flightless birds found in jungle biomes. They can be found on the ground or in nearby water sources with their legs tucked in as they swim. They are quite small birds that cannot be scared away. If they are punched, they will panic and attempt to flee, but a player can tempt them back with seeds.

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Taming, Healing, & Feeding

Kiwis can be tamed with [wheat seeds](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Wheat_Seeds). There is a 50% chance of successful taming. Once they are tamed, you will see hearts appear and a ribbon on their left leg signifying you have tamed the bird. You can [dye](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Dye) the ribbon to your color of choice or use [shears](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Shears) to cut off the ribbon. If you shear the ribbon, it can be reapplied by using a dye color of your choice. 

Tamed kiwis can be commanded to sit or to follow.

- Kiwis will teleport to the player if the player is further than 10 blocks away.
- Kiwis will not teleport to the player if they are commanded to sit.

If a kiwi you have tamed gets injured, you can feed it wheat seeds to increase its [health](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Health) until it is maxed. 1 seed increased the kiwi‚Äôs health points by 1. An injured kiwi will be unable to breed until it is healed.

### ü•öBreeding

Kiwi birds are required to be tamed before they can be [bred](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Breeding). Kiwis can be bred with [wheat seeds](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Wheat_Seeds), [pumpkin seeds](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pumpkin_Seeds), [melon seeds](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Melon_Seeds), and [beetroot seeds](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Beetroot_Seeds). There is a 5-minute cooldown for breeding, during which the kiwi does not accept any seeds for breeding but will accept wheat seeds if they get injured and need to heal.

Upon successful breeding, a chick will be born. The growth of chicks can be slowly accelerated with [wheat seeds](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Wheat_Seeds), [pumpkin seeds](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pumpkin_Seeds), [melon seeds](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Melon_Seeds), and [beetroot seeds](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Beetroot_Seeds).
