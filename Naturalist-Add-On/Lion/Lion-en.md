Lions are the second largest big cat species worldwide, and they primarily reside in Africa. Interestingly, lionesses (female lions) do most of the hunting for their pride and reach up to top speeds of 50 mph. A lion‚Äôs mane will grow longer as the lion ages, it never stops growing. Their roar can carry up to 5 miles from the source.

### üß† Behavior

Lions, upon spawning, will assign one of the female lions as the leader of their pride. If their leader dies, a new leader will be appointed. Lions follow their pride leader and will hunt in their pack at night. 

When hunting at night, lions will slowly stalk their prey before getting close enough to sprint and attack them. Lion cubs do not attack other animals; however, they will still follow their parents. Lions will hunt rhinos and horses.

Lions do not attack players unless the player attacks them or approaches their cubs first. At which point, lions will get angry (their eyes will turn red) and attack the player until either the player dies, the lion is killed, or the player is out of sight of the lion.

Lions will take long naps between the ticks of 6000 and 13000. They will not sleep if they are in the water. If hit while sleeping, they will wake up in an aggressive state and will go back to sleep once they either kill their target or lose sight of them.

### ü•öBreeding

Adult lions can be [bred](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Breeding) with a variety of raw meat. There is a 5-minute cooldown for breeding, during which the lion will not accept any food items for breeding.

Upon successful breeding, a cub will be born. The growth of cubs cannot be accelerated by food items and they take a full Minecraft day to grow into a mature adult.

**List of items for breeding:**

Raw Meat: [Raw Beef](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Raw_Beef), [Raw Chicken](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Raw_Chicken), [Raw Porkchop](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Raw_Porkchop), [Raw Mutton](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Raw_Mutton), Raw Bass, Raw Bushmeat, Raw Catfish, Raw Clam Meat, Raw Crab Meat, Raw Drumsticks, Raw Duck, Raw Goose, Raw Mammoth Meat, Raw Moose Meat, and Raw Venison.

*Note: Only male lions and female lions are capable of breeding. You cannot breed two male lions or two female lions.*
