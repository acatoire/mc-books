Moles have poor eyesight and rely on their sense of touch and smell to navigate their surroundings. They have powerful limbs with spade-like paws that are for digging through soil, which they spend most of their time doing. Their diets primarily consist of bugs they find, mainly beetles. Moles aerate the soil with their digging, this helps promote healthy crops.

### üß† Behavior

Moles are passive animals and are incredibly skittish around players. They can burrow underground and move around while digging. Players can follow their trail with the dug-up dirt they leave behind. Moles move slowly on the surface or can sit on the mounds they‚Äôve created. If a player approaches too fast, the mole will quickly burrow.

### ü•öBreeding

Adult moles can be bred with beetles (red, brown, green, yellow, and black). There is a 5-minute cooldown for breeding, during which the mole does not accept beetles for breeding. 

Upon successful breeding, a pup will be born. The growth of pups can be slowly accelerated by feeding them beetles.
