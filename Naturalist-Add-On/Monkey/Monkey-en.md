Monkeys are intelligent primates found in both the Americas (North and South), Africa, and Asia. Their diets, depending on fruits and vegetables, are essential for taming and breeding them. Most monkeys live in groups and are fierce protectors over their young and will even protect you!

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Taming, Healing, & Feeding

Monkeys can be tamed with [apples](/minecraft.wiki/w/Apple) and [carrots](/minecraft.wiki/w/Carrot).  There is a 50% chance of successful taming. Once they are tamed, you will see hearts appear and a shirt on their body signifying you have tamed the monkey. You can [dye](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Dye) the shirt to your color of choice or use [shears](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Shears) to cut off the shirt. If you shear off the shirt, it can be reapplied by using a dye color of your choice.

Tamed monkeys can be commanded to sit or to follow.

- Monkeys will teleport to the player if the player is further than 10 blocks away.
- Monkeys will not teleport to the player if they are commanded to sit.

If a monkey you have tamed gets injured, you can feed the monkey apples or carrots to increase its [health](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Health) until it is maxed. 1 apple or carrot increases the monkey‚Äôs health points by 2. An injured monkey will be unable to breed until it is healed.

### ü•öBreeding

Adult monkeys can be [bred](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Breeding) with [apples](/minecraft.wiki/w/Apple) and [carrots](/minecraft.wiki/w/Carrot). There is a 5-minute cooldown for breeding, during which the monkey does not accept apples or carrots for breeding but will if they get injured and need to heal.

Upon successful breeding, an infant is born. The growth rate of infants can be slowly accelerated by using apples or carrots.
