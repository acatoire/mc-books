Orcas are the largest members of the dolphin family that navigate oceanic waters with sonar called echolocation. They can swim up to 30 mph and travel 75-100 miles or more per day. These unique creatures hunt in pods and consume sea creatures ranging from small fish to large seals.

### üß† Behavior

Orcas are large aquatic beasts that roam the oceans in a pod. They are mostly passive, but they feast on fish and the occasional penguin. They will not attack pufferfish, though, as they are not tasty snacks!

Orcas will attack a player when they are provoked. They swim much faster when chasing their target and are relentless until either the player is out of sight or dies.

**Weakness:**

Orcas are unable to survive out of water. Outside of water, they will attempt to navigate back to a water source. If they are unsuccessful, they start to suffocate and die.
