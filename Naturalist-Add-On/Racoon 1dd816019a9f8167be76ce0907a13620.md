Racoons are devious animals that are distinct by their black mask markings around their eyes. They have five fingers, much like humans, and scrounge urban and rural areas to find food. These animals love to open containers, especially those they find challenging, to reach their goal. Raccoons are known to dip their food in water before they eat, and they inspect their food after watching them before eating.

### üß† Behavior

Raccoons are adventurous, passive animals that can be found with items in their mouths. 

Raccoons will scrounge around inside barrels, chests, and trapped chests until they find an item to steal. If a player hits a raccoon that is actively searching a container, they will stop searching and try to flee from the player. Baby raccoons will not search inside containers, but they will follow their parents until they are mature adults.

Raccoons sleep between the [ticks](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tick) of 6000-13000. If hit while sleeping, they will wake up, attempt to flee, and go back to sleep once they are successful.

### ü•öBreeding

Adult raccoons can be [bred](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Breeding) with [glow berries](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Glow_Berries) and [sweet berries](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Sweet_Berries). There is a 5-minute cooldown for breeding, during which the raccoon does not accept any berries for breeding. 

Upon successful breeding, a cub will be born. The growth of cubs can be slowly accelerated by using berries.
