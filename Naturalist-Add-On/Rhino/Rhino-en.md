Rhinos are found in Africa and South Asia. They are large animals known for their pointy noses that are made of the same material as human fingernails! Their skin is as tough as armor, which makes them tough to hunt by predators such as lions. Rhinos are territorial animals and will charge at anything that poses a threat to them or their family.

### üß† Behavior

Rhinos are large creatures that roam the savannas. They are distinctive by their large horns and stumpy legs. Occasionally, they will have a calf following them.

Rhinos are passive unless they (or their calves) are attacked by a player or another mob. If they are attacked by a player, they will scrape their foot on the ground a few times before quickly charging in a straight line. Upon hitting the player, they will be knocked into the air as well as backward a bit, similar to iron golems.

If they are attacked by mobs, rhinos will attack them back normally without charging. They will use their large horn to attack back, continuously hitting them until they are no longer a threat.
