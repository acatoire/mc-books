Snails are small gastropods with hard shells that almost always twist clockwise. Each shell is unique in its own way, with special coloration that makes no two snails alike. They grow the size of their shell throughout their entire life, and they will hide in these shells when they are scared. They have slimy, moist skin that helps them glide over surfaces and stay hydrated.

A walk of 1-3 snails spawn in the [forest](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Forest), [mangrove swamp](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Swamp), [mooshroom island](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Mushroom_Fields), [plains](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Plains), [savanna](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Savanna), and [swamp](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Swamp) biomes.

### üß† Behavior

Snails are passive gastropods with hard shells that slide their way across the ground. They will avoid players, but they aren‚Äôt very fast in doing so. Players will find snails in the wild only in their standard variant, but the player can use dye to dye their shells!

The player may collect a snail by¬†using¬†a¬†[bucket](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Bucket)¬†on it, which gives the player a¬†bucket of snail (in their shell color variant). Snails placed with buckets do not despawn naturally. When that bucket is¬†used¬†against a block, it empties the bucket, placing the snail on the ground. Snails cannot be put in a [cauldron](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Cauldron).

---

### ü•öBreeding

Snails can be [bred](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Breeding) with [beetroot](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Beetroot). There is a 5-minute cooldown for breeding, during which the snail does not accept any beetroot for breeding. 

Upon successful breeding, the snail will find [sand](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Sand), [grass](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Grass_Block), [dirt](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Dirt), [mud](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Mud), [snow](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Snow_Block), [ice](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Ice), [packed ice](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Packed_Ice), [blue ice](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Blue_Ice), [stone](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Stone), [deepslate](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Deepslate), [netherrack](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Netherrack), or [end stone](https://minecraft.wiki/w/End_Stone) to lay their egg on. If in survival mode, the egg can be broken with 1 hit, and it will drop as an item. Once the egg is placed in the world, the egg hatch timer will restart. When the hatchling is viable, it will emerge from its egg!
