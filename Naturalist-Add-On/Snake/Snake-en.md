Snakes are long, slithery reptiles with over 3 thousand species worldwide. They are powerful predators that can‚Äôt bite their food, so they will swallow it whole. Their flexible jaws allow them to eat prey bigger than their head. They have internal ears that allow them to detect movements and hear their prey before they strike with their powerful fangs.

### ‚öîÔ∏è Drops

Snake [drops](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Drops) upon death:

- 1 Morsel
- 1 Tooth

*Note: The tooth has a chance to drop but is not guaranteed upon death.*

- üü¢ 5 [Experience](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Experience) Orbs if killed by Player.
- üü¢ 1 - 7 Experience Orbs upon [breeding](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Breeding).

*Snakelets yield no items nor experience.*

Snakes are natural predators of small wild animals. If you kill a snake, there is a chance you might find out what they recently consumed! Below is a list of items you can find in their stomachs:

- [Chicken](/minecraft.wiki/w/Raw_Chicken)
- [Rabbit](/minecraft.wiki/w/Raw_Rabbit)
- [Rabbit Foot](/minecraft.wiki/w/Rabbit%27s_Foot)
- [Slime Ball](/minecraft.wiki/w/Slimeball)

### üß† Behavior

Snakes are neutral reptiles that slither across the ground, constantly searching for their next meal.

Snakes will hunt rabbits, chickens, silverfish, and snails. Items drop from Snakes when they are harmed if they have recently hunted. Upon return, the snake will attack the player or mob that hurt it. If a snake has no item in its stomach, it will search out dropped items that it can eat and will consume them. After 6,000 [ticks](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tick) or **5 minutes**, the item will be digested, and its stomach will be emptied.

Snakes sleep from the ticks of 12,000-18,000 and 23,000 to 28,000. If attacked while sleeping, they will wake up angry and will not go back to sleep for a little while after either losing range or killing what attacked them.

Rattlesnakes rattle when players come close to them.

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Taming, Healing, & Feeding

Snakes can be tamed with [spider eyes](/minecraft.wiki/w/Spider_Eye). There is a 50% chance of successful taming. Once they are tamed, you will see hearts appear. There is no visual indication that they are tamed other than the hearts.

Tamed snakes cannot be commanded, nor will they follow a player at any time. To keep your snake within a certain area, you can put a lead on them and tie them to a fence or build a corral around them.

If a snake you have tamed gets injured, you can feed the snake spider eyes to increase its [health](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Health) until it is maxed. 1 spider eye increases the snake‚Äôs health points by 2. An injured snake will be unable to breed until it is healed.

---

### ü•öBreeding

Snakes with full health can be [bred](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Breeding) with [spider eyes](/minecraft.wiki/w/Spider_Eye), [raw rabbit](/minecraft.wiki/w/Raw_Rabbit), raw morsel, and cooked morsel. There is a 5-minute cooldown for breeding, during which the snake does not accept any items for breeding but will accept spider eyes if they get injured and need to heal. 

The two snakes will lay an egg after successful breeding. Snakes will find [sand](/minecraft.wiki/w/Sand), [grass](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Grass_Block), [dirt](/minecraft.wiki/w/Dirt), [mud](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Mud), [snow](/minecraft.wiki/w/Snow_Block), [ice](/minecraft.wiki/w/Ice), [packed ice](/minecraft.wiki/w/Packed_Ice), [blue ice](/minecraft.wiki/w/Blue_Ice), [stone](/minecraft.wiki/w/Stone), [deepslate](/minecraft.wiki/w/Deepslate), [netherrack](/minecraft.wiki/w/Netherrack), or [end stone](/minecraft.wiki/w/End_Stone) to lay their egg on. If in survival mode, the egg can be broken with 1 hit, and it will drop as an item. Once the egg is placed in the world, the egg hatch timer will restart. When the snakelet is viable, it will appear from its egg!

**Note:** *When breeding, the snakes must be of the same variant. Crossbreeding snakes of different variations will not work.*
