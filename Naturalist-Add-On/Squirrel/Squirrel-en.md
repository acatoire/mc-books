Squirrels are playful animals found everywhere except for Antartica and Australia. Much like other rodents, their front teeth never stop growing, and they will gnaw on a variety of nuts to wear down their teeth. Squirrels will hoard multiple stashes of food around the forest to keep them fed year-round but carefully cover their stashes to protect them from potential thieves. While it‚Äôs not intended, their stashes of seeds have been known to grow trees!

### üß† Behavior

Squirrels are entirely passive animals that roam plentiful forests. These animals are skittish, so if a player wants to get close to a squirrel they must crouch and approach slowly. Squirrels enjoy snacking on sweet berries and glow berries, so they will let a player get close to them when those items are held out (much like a cat with fish).

Squirrels are incredibly active animals; however, they enjoy taking long naps between tickets 6000 - 13000. They will not nap in the water but don‚Äôt mind napping through a thunderstorm. If a player approaches a squirrel while it is napping, they will wake up and flee from the player before resuming their nap.

If a player attacks a squirrel, it will flee from the player.

Baby squirrels will follow the parents until they are mature adults.

### ü•öBreeding

Adult squirrels can be [bred](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Breeding) with [glow berries](/minecraft.wiki/w/Glow_Berries) and [sweet berries](/minecraft.wiki/w/Sweet_Berries). There is a 5-minute cooldown for breeding, during which the squirrel will not accept berries for breeding.

Upon successful breeding, a pup will be born. The growth of pups can be slowly accelerated by using glow berries and sweet berries.
