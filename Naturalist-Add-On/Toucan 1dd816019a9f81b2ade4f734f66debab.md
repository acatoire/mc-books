Toucans live in Central and South America, native to tropical rainforests. These birds are well recognized worldwide based on their bright colorations on their long beak and chests. These birds love to feast on fruits with their tongues ranging up to half a foot long. Toucans can regulate their body temperature by adjusting blood flow to their beaks!

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Taming, Healing, & Feeding

Toucans can be tamed with [wheat seeds](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Wheat_Seeds), [pumpkin seeds](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pumpkin_Seeds), [melon seeds](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Melon_Seeds), and [beetroot seeds](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Beetroot_Seeds).  There is a 33% chance of successful taming. Once they are tamed, you will see hearts appear and a ribbon on their left leg signifying you have tamed the bird. You can [dye](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Dye) the ribbon to your color of choice or use [shears](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Shears) to cut off the ribbon. If you shear off the ribbon, it can be reapplied by using a dye color of your choice.

Tamed toucans can be commanded to sit or to follow.

- Toucans will teleport to the player if the player is further than 5 blocks away.
- Toucans will not teleport to the player if they are commanded to sit.

If a toucan you have tamed gets injured, you can feed the toucan wheat seeds, pumpkin seeds, melon seeds, or beetroot seeds to increase its [health](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Health) until it is maxed. 1 seed increases the toucan‚Äôs health points by 2.

Feeding these birds a [cookie](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Cookie) will cause [Fatal Poison](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Fatal_Poison) particles to be emitted, and they will lose health points. Chocolate is toxic to birds.
