Turkeys are large, ground-dwelling birds native to North America. They are distinctive with their large fan-shaped tail and colorful plumage. They are omnivores, feeding on a variety of seeds, and are highly adaptable to their surroundings. They are skilled fliers and runners, which help protect them and their flock from predators.

### üß† Behavior

Turkeys are skittish birds that will run away when a player approaches. To prevent a turkey from running away, they can be tempted with seeds, which is useful for breeding them or having them follow a player back home. Turkeys are usually loud animals, meaning their gobbles can be heard from quite a distance. Sometimes, they can be spotted eating those pesky beetles!

### ü•öBreeding

Turkeys can be [bred](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Breeding) with [wheat seeds](/minecraft.wiki/w/Wheat_Seeds), [beetroot seeds](/minecraft.wiki/w/Beetroot_Seeds), [melon seeds](/minecraft.wiki/w/Melon_Seeds), [pumpkin seeds](/minecraft.wiki/w/Pumpkin_Seeds), [pitcher pods](/minecraft.wiki/w/Pitcher_Pod), and [torchflower seeds](/minecraft.wiki/w/Torchflower_Seeds). There is a 5-minute cooldown for breeding, during which the turkey will not accept any seeds for breeding.

Upon successful breeding, a chick will be born. The growth of chicks can be slowly accelerated by using seeds.
