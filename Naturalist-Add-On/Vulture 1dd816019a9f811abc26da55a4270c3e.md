Vultures reside in most continents worldwide except for Antartica and Australia. They are social birds that travel and eat in flocks. Vultures do not have a voice box; therefore, they cannot sing like most other birds. They have an incredible sense of smell and sight, which helps them find food that is over a mile away.

### 🧠 Behavior

Vultures are large birds that soar the skies of deserts and savanna biomes. They fly high above the ground and will attack zombies at night! While they can’t be tamed or bred, they are good protectors to have near your home to keep you safe from zombies, zombie horses, or any zombie variant mobs that may come through your nether portal.
