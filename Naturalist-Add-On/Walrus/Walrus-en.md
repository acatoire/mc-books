Walruses thrive in frozen habitats in the Arctic Circle. Walruses have a thick blubber, up to 15cm thick, helping them stay warm in the cold waters. They have elongated tusks that can reach over 3 feet in length. They utilize their whiskers to locate their food while they are in the water. Walruses can slow down their heartbeat to help them withstand the cold water, and they can remain underwater for longer periods with this strategy.

### üåé Spawning

A herd of 1-3 walruses will spawn anywhere frozen. The only requirement is that there is [ice](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Ice) for the walruses to spawn on. These walruses will not spawn under the ice, so no need to go swimming! They will spawn during the daytime with [light levels](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Light) between 7-15.

### üß† Behavior

Walruses can exist in a passive or hostile state. The calves are passive; adults are hostile when provoked with calves. If a calf is attacked, unless killed in one hit‚Äå, all adults within the area become hostile toward the player or mob, regardless of [difficulty](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Difficulty). Calves will always follow their parent until they are mature.

Walruses like to lie down on the ice. If hit while lying down, they will get up in an aggressive state and will lie down once they either kill their target or lose sight of them.
