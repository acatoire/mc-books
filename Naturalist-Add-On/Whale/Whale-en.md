Whales are large marine mammals that are found in oceans worldwide. Whales are commonly known for their impressive size and long migrations. Much like sharks, they play a crucial role in the marine ecosystems. Some species feed on plankton and small fish, while other species hunt prey such as fish, squid, and other marine mammals.

### üß† Behavior

Whales are large aquatic beasts that roam the oceans in a pod. They are exclusively passive animals that swim aimlessly. They do not attack other fish, nor will they attack players, even if the player attacks them first.

**Weakness:**

Whales are unable to survive out of water. Outside of water, they will attempt to navigate back to a water source. If they are unsuccessful, they start to suffocate and die.
