Zebras reside in Eastern and Southern Africa. Each zebra is unique with its distinctive pattern of black and white stripes. Zebras can run up to 40 mph, but unfortunately, sometimes, this is not fast enough to outrun some predators. Zebras sleep standing up; luckily, they have a sharp sense of smell and hearing to alert them to nearby predators.

Zebra [drops](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Drops) upon death:

- üü¢ 1 - 3 [Experience](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Experience) Orbs if killed by Player.
- üü¢ 1 - 7 Experience Orbs upon [breeding](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Breeding).

*Colts yield no items nor experience.*

### üß† Behavior

Zebras are passive animals that meander the savanna biomes. They can be easily distinguished by their unique black and white coloration. If a player approaches a zebra, the zebra will turn away quickly and run away, which makes them hard to catch and tame. 

Colts will follow their parents until they are mature. Players are unable to put a saddle on a colt or ride it.

Once a zebra is tamed, they can be [saddled](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Saddle) and carry a chest of items that can be accessed by opening the inventory while riding the zebra.

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Taming, Healing, & Feeding

Zebras can be tamed by riding the zebra until it no longer kicks you off its back. You can feed it [golden apples](Zebra%201dd816019a9f8153880ff68703a7db6f.md) and [golden carrots](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Golden_Carrot) to decrease its temper. There is a 33% chance of successful taming. Once they are tamed, you will see hearts appear. There is no visual indication that they are tamed other than the hearts, however, a zebra will let you ride it once it is tamed.

Tamed zebras cannot be commanded, nor will they follow a player at any time. To keep your zebra within a certain area, you can put a [lead](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Lead) on them and tie them to a [fence](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Wooden_Fence) or build a corral around them. 

You can put a [saddle](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Saddle) on a zebra once it is tamed. You can open the zebra‚Äôs inventory when you are riding it to add or remove a saddle.

If a zebra you have tamed gets injured, you can feed the zebra a variety of items to increase its [health](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Health) until it is maxed. The breakdown of items with applicable health points is broken down below. An injured zebra will be unable to breed until it is healed.

**Heath Points per Item:**

**1 Health Point:** [Sugar](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Sugar)

**2 Health Points:** [Wheat](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Wheat)

**3 Health Points:** [Apple](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Apple)

**4 Health Points:** [Golden Carrot](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Golden_Carrot)

**10 Health Points:** [Golden Apple](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Golden_Apple) & [Enchanted Golden Apple](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Enchanted_Golden_Apple)

**20 Heath Points:** [Hay Block](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Hay_Bale)

### ü•öBreeding

Zebras require to be tamed before they can be [bred](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Breeding). Zebras can be bred with [golden carrots](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Golden_Carrot), [golden apples](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Golden_Apple), and [enchanted golden apples](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Enchanted_Golden_Apple). There is a 5-minute cooldown for breeding, during which the zebra will not accept any items for breeding but will if they get injured and need to heal.

Upon successful breeding, a colt will be born. The growth of colts can be slowly accelerated by using [wheat](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Wheat), [sugar](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Sugar), [hay blocks](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Hay_Bale), [apples](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Apple), [golden carrots](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Golden_Carrot), [golden apples](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Golden_Apple), and [enchanted golden apples](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Enchanted_Golden_Apple).
