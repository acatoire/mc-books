description:
  en: Jellyfish are aquatic creatures but are not classified as fish. They are invertebrates
    that move gelatinously through the water. They come in many shapes and bright,
    vibrant colors. They utilize tentacles to catch their food along with their bodies
    that deliver stings to any creature that brushes against it.

    en: Behavior
  description:
    en: Jellyfish move in clusters across the ocean. Their bright colors make them
      easily identifiable, but they tend to blend in with coral reefs. Jellyfish are
      passive aquatic creatures; however, if a player brushes up against one, they
      will be stung. This damage mimics running into a cactus. The player may collect
      jellyfish and small jellyfish by using a water bucket on it, which gives the
      player a bucket of jellyfish/bucket of small jellyfish (with their variant color).
      Jellyfish placed with buckets do not despawn naturally. When that bucket is
      used against a block, it empties the bucket, placing water with the jellyfish
      swimming in it.
  weakness:
    en: Jellyfish are unable to survive out of water. Outside of water, they lay with
      tentacles splayed around them until, eventually, they start to suffocate and
      die. Jellyfish cannot be put in a cauldron.
