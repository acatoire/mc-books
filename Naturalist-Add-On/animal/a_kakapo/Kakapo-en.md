Kakapos reside in New Zealand and are often called ‚ÄúOwl Parrots‚Äù due to their nocturnal behaviors. They are the largest species of parrots and are incapable of flight. When kakapos sense danger, they will freeze to attempt to blend in with their surroundings and become invisible.

### üåé Spawning

A flock of 1-2 kakapos will spawn in [dark oak forests](/minecraft.wiki/w/Dark_Forest), [mega taigas](/minecraft.wiki/w/Old_Growth_Pine_Taiga), and [lush caves](/minecraft.wiki/w/Lush_Caves). They thrive in dark environments, so they will be spotted under the coverage of tree leaves or in caves. They spawn exclusively in these dark areas with [light levels](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Light) of 0-7.

### üß† Behavior

Kakapos are chunky, passive birds that roam around the forest floors or lush caves. They love taking long naps during the day.

Tamed Kakapos can be fed Spore Blossoms to temporarily give the player [Speed](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Speed) and [Night Vision](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Night_Vision), making them a useful nighttime companion.

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Taming, Healing, & Feeding

Kakapos can be tamed with [glow berries](/minecraft.wiki/w/Glow_Berries). There is a 33% chance of successful taming. Once they are tamed, you will see hearts appear. There is no other indication that they are tamed other than hearts and that they can be commanded.

Tamed kakapos can be commanded to sit or to follow.

- Kakapos will teleport to the player if the player is further than 10 blocks away.
- Kakapos will not teleport to the player if they are commanded to sit.

If the kakapos you have tamed get injured, you can feed the kakapo [spore blossoms](/minecraft.wiki/w/Spore_Blossom) to increase its [health](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Health) until it is maxed. 1 spore blossom increases the kakapo's health points by 2.
