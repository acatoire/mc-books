  description:
    en: Orcas are large aquatic beasts that roam the oceans in a pod. They are mostly
      passive, but they feast on fish and the occasional penguin. They will not attack
      pufferfish, though, as they are not tasty snacks! Orcas will attack a player
      when they are provoked. They swim much faster when chasing their target and
      are relentless until either the player is out of sight or dies.
  weakness:
    en: Orcas are unable to survive out of water. Outside of water, they will attempt
      to navigate back to a water source. If they are unsuccessful, they start to
      suffocate and die.
