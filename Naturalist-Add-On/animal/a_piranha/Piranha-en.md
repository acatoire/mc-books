Piranhas are native to South American rivers, and their name quite literally means “tooth fish”. They have a single row of sharp, triangular teeth in both jaws that are so strong that they can bite through a steel fishing hook! These fish have a strong sense of smell and are known to eat fruits, seeds, and aquatic plants. Piranhas are not as dangerous as portrayed; they only attack when threatened as a self-defense mechanism.

### 🧠 Behavior

Piranhas are hostile aquatic fish that tend to swim in schools, with a maximum of eight per school. When a player gets too close to a piranha, they will attack the player with a fierce bite.

The player may collect piranhas by using a [water bucket](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Water_bucket) on it, which gives the player a bucket of piranha. Piranhas placed with buckets do not despawn naturally. When that fish bucket is used against a block, it empties the bucket, placing water with the piranha swimming in it.

**Weakness:**

Piranhas are unable to survive out of water. Outside of water, they flop around for a while until, eventually, they start to suffocate and die. Piranhas cannot be put in a [cauldron](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Cauldron).

Piranhas are vulnerable to weapons that have the [Impaling](Bass%201dd816019a9f81379eecf7c25ed7e23f.md) enchantment.
