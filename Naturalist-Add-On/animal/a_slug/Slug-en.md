Slugs can be found worldwide and prefer to hide in dark spaces underground, such as caves. Their bodies are composed of 85-90% water and secrete a thick slime that is crucial for them to glide on the ground, and it trails behind them as they move along. Slugs eat a large number of fruits and vegetables, particularly those with high water content. They are incredibly slow, reaching a top speed  of 0.18 mph!

### 🧠 Behavior

Slugs are colorful, passive crawlers that enjoy dark environments. Slugs are so small that they can go unnoticed while they slide by. If a player is running through a dark cave and suddenly bounces, they may think they bounced on a slime block. In reality, they found themselves an unsuspecting slug!

The player may collect a slug by using a [bucket](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Bucket) on it, which gives the player a bucket of slug (in their color variant). Slugs placed with buckets do not despawn naturally. When that bucket is used against a block, it empties the bucket, placing slug on the ground. Slugs cannot be put in a [cauldron](/minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Cauldron).
